Every year around the holiday season, Dominique and Simone's friends eagerly look forward to their annual holiday friend potluck. This year, since they can't meet in person to share food and company, they're trying something new: a virtual potluck!
 
Each of their friends is going to be presenting a home-cooked dish or group of dishes from their holiday traditions and culture that's meaningful to them. Each week, you can log on to the Seasons of Serverless site to solve another unique code challenge presented by one of Dominique and Simone's friends and focused on a culinary tradition from around the world.
